# Machine-Learning-based-Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machine
Industrial machines have vital components such as maintenance and repairability. It is imperative for these machines to stay in 
optimum conditions to be able to provide the best productivity both in terms of the number of products being produced in a given time period 
along with keeping up to standards the quality of the product. It is increasingly becoming important to reduce the downtime and maintenance 
periods of the machine to make sure that the machine is able to be productive for the longest time of its lifecycle. 
A technique known by the name of predictive maintenance has emerged recently that works in solving this problem as it preempts the maintenance 
frequency and schedule of the machine by looking and gauging the current conditions of the machine and its vital components. 
This results in a great deal of information regarding a physical machine. The current conditions of the machine alone do not do a great deal 
for predicting the maintenance regime, this is where algorithms or estimators based on machine learning paradigms are trained and executed to 
accurately forecast the condition and subsequently the maintenance regime of the machine. The research work has been carried out on real-time 
actual data of a machine using different parameters such as current and voltage to get useful insights about the machine. 
The data is used to develop different machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier and 
Na√Øve Bayes theorem. The research work concludes with comparative analysis of the performance of these machine learning models and 
provides graphical representations for easy comprehension
